# OPEN-CHAT
welcome to the Open-Chat github repo in this file I will demonstrate the uses of NZ-MAfia aswell as how to build it yourself using the repo's files 
# install 
to install the app simply navigate to the releases page of this repo and download the latest one. any problems with the release will most likley be listed in the releases description, click on the exe file under the release and wait for that  to download. 
once it has downloaded run the file and the app setup will start. after the setup has finished the app will run. 
# navigation 
when the app has opened you will be met with a blank page while the app starts up its data transfer server this is necercery for the apps function, after a few seconds you should be greeted with a ToS screen propting you to accept ToS if you do not agree with the Tos you can close and uninstall the application. after you have accepted the ToS you will be showen the general page which will display the general chat of the application,
## general 
this general chat can be defined by looking at the typing bar at the bottom of the screen showing "Message General". inside general you have a completly private experience nobody can identfy any messages you write as it is annoynumous to other people, the gui will show the messages you type to the left and with a gradient and other peoples messages will be pushed to the right in grey that way you can keep track of who is talking at one time. general chat is the main database chat for anybody using the app to see. to send messages in any chat click on the input at the bottom of the screen it will usually say "message general" or "message chat" depending on if you are in a private chatroom or in the public general. 
## groups 
groups are a big part of Open-Chat, you can visit the groups page by clicking on the account icon at the bottom-left of the main page, once this is opened you will be showen a list of groups with a password box next to each, to enter a chat room clcik on the input next to the group you want to enter before typing in the groups password.
## misc 
some tips for use are as follows, in the general chat you can click on a message to show the timestamp of the message, in a group chat you can do the same thing but in a group it also displays the username of the person who sent the message, to create a group do as follows go to this website ```127.0.0.1:5000/start_group/<group name>,<group password>``` while the app is running replace the group name and the group password with what you want hte group to be called and what you want the password to be.
